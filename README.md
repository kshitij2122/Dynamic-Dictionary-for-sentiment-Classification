# Dynamic-Dictionary-for-sentiment-Classification
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction
task that aims to obtain a writer’s feelings expressed in positive or negative
comments, questions, and requests, by analyzing large numbers of documents.
Generally speaking, Sentiment analysis concerning the subject of the speaker or an
author's point of view or a document to determine the overall functionality. Sentiment
Analysis uses various classification techniques to identify the tone of a given piece of
text. It indicates whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.
There are 3 ways for carrying out sentimental classification:
1) Linguistic approach that consists of sentence classification by using the words of
the lexicon. This lexicon is constructed with automatic natural language processing
tools.
2) The second approach is statistical that concerns the supervised learning methods
(like SVM ”Support Vector Machines” and NB ”Naive Bayesian classifiers”).
3)The hybrid approach that combines linguistic and statistical approach.
A traditional dictionary-based sentiment classification approach uses word matching
based on the lexicon. However, many posts cannot be analyzed by traditional
dictionary-based sentiment classifier due to the absence of the sentiment words in
the lexicon. For this reason, it is needed to expand the lexicon so that the lexicon
can contain the words.

About the project:
The project aims to create a dynamic dictionary for the identification of
sentiment. The dictionary should be able to pick up specific jargon based on
the type of data/ website.
We propose a new method to regroup dynamically the words present in a corpus into
the sentiment dictionaries. Then, we exploit these words in order to classify the
sentences.
